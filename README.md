#### Building Machine Learning Pipelines in PySpark MLlib
Welcome to the hands-on project on Building Machine Learning Pipelines in PySpark MLlib. This project is part of coursera project 'Building Machine Learning Pipelines in PySpark MLlib'. The project is divided into several tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of the pipeline.

#### Project Structure
The project is organized into the following tasks:

#### Task 1: Install Spark on Google Colab and Load a Dataset in PySpark
In this task, we'll learn how to set up Spark on Google Colab and load a dataset into a PySpark DataFrame. This step is crucial to prepare your environment for the upcoming tasks.

#### Task 2: Describe and Clean Your Dataset
Before building a machine learning model, it's essential to understand the dataset. In this task, we'll explore the dataset's structure, check for missing values, and outliers, and perform necessary cleaning operations.

#### Task 3: Create a Random Forest Pipeline to Predict Car Prices
Here, we'll create a machine learning pipeline using PySpark's MLlib. Specifically, we'll build a Random Forest regression pipeline to predict car prices. This task will cover data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and creating a complete pipeline.

#### Task 4: Create a Cross Validator for Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameter tuning is essential to optimize the model's performance. In this task, we'll create a cross-validator to perform k-fold cross-validation and evaluate different hyperparameter combinations. This will help you find the best set of hyperparameters for your model.

#### Task 5: Train Your Model and Predict Test Set Car Prices
With this pipeline and hyperparameters ready, it's time to train the model on the training dataset. we'll then use the trained model to make predictions on the test dataset and assess its performance.

#### Task 6: Evaluate Your Modelâ€™s Performance via Several Metrics
Evaluating the model involves more than just accuracy. In this task, we'll explore various evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the machine learning model comprehensively. This includes metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and more.
